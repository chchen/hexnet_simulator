This requires the following software to build:

Java Development Kit 1.8 or higher,
Apache Ant

1) Create a file in the source root called "hexbricks.properties" that has the following line:

jdk.home.1.8=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk/Contents/Home

Your jdk.home.1.8 value will vary depending on your machine, and where you have Java installed.

2) Run "ant" in your source root.

This will compile the class files and create a JAR executable which you can then run.
The test JAR is placed in out/artifacts/hexbricks_jar.

3) Run the test program:

java -jar out/artifacts/hexbricks_jar/hexbricks.jar
